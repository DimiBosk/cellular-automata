Some simple tasks for cellular automata

I have write code about 3 different cellular automata. Two of these are one dimensional cellular automata kai both of them have as a rule the mod2, the first
is periodic and the second is adiabatic. The third cellular automato is two dimensional and has as a rule the OR, is periodic and the  neighborhoud 
of each cell is Von Neumann.
